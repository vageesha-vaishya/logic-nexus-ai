# Project Rules

## CRM Module Header Rules
- Use `CRMModuleHeaderNavigation` for Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, Activities, and Quotes.
- Keep action order fixed: Pipeline, Card, Grid, List, New, Refresh, Import/Export, Theme.
- Keep lead module create label as `New Lead`.
- Use `useCRMModuleNavigationState` for module view and theme persistence.
- Use `Azure Sky` as the default theme fallback in CRM module state.
- Keep pipeline as the default view mode unless a module has a stronger product requirement.
- Keep view and theme persistence in browser storage and reuse on remount.
- Use `ScopedDataAccess` for all data refresh callbacks used by header controls.
