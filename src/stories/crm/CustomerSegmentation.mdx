# Customer Segmentation

This component provides visual insights into customer segments using multiple criteria:
- Demographic (industry, title, company size)
- Behavioral (email opens, site visits, recency)
- Geographic (region, country)

## Performance

- Charts use Recharts with responsive containers
- Minimal render work via useMemo for transformed datasets
- Avoids heavy DOM updates by limiting legend and tooltip complexity

## Accessibility

- Charts include legends and tooltips for interpretability
- Tab interface supports keyboard navigation
- Buttons and actions include descriptive labels

## Usage

<Canvas>
