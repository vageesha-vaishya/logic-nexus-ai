# CRM Component Library

This module contains a comprehensive suite of enterprise-grade React components designed for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications. These components are built with **Shadcn UI**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and type safety.

## Core Components

The library is organized into functional groups covering the entire CRM lifecycle:

### 1. Lead & Pipeline Management
- **[ProfileHeader](?path=/docs/crm-profileheader--docs)**: Rich header for Lead/Contact profiles with quick actions and stats.
- **[PipelineBoard](?path=/docs/crm-pipelineboard--docs)**: Kanban-style board for managing deal stages with drag-and-drop support.
- **[DealWizard](?path=/docs/crm-dealwizard--docs)**: Multi-step wizard for creating complex opportunities.

### 2. Data & Analytics
- **[DataTable](?path=/docs/crm-datatable--docs)**: High-density data grid with sorting, filtering, and view modes (List/Board).
- **[AnalyticsDashboard](?path=/docs/crm-analyticsdashboard--docs)**: Visual dashboard for pipeline health, conversion rates, and revenue forecasting.
- **[AdvancedFilter](?path=/docs/crm-advancedfilter--docs)**: Complex filtering engine with support for multiple conditions and saved presets.

### 3. Activity & Collaboration
- **[InteractionTimeline](?path=/docs/crm-interactiontimeline--docs)**: Chronological view of all customer interactions (calls, emails, meetings).
- **[TaskScheduler](?path=/docs/crm-taskscheduler--docs)**: Task management system with "Upcoming", "Overdue", and "Completed" views.
- **[TeamAssignment](?path=/docs/crm-teamassignment--docs)**: Role-based access control and team member management for deals.
- **[DocumentRepository](?path=/docs/crm-documentrepository--docs)**: File management system with preview, search, and categorization.

## Design Principles

- **Accessibility**: All components follow WAI-ARIA patterns and are keyboard navigable.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design ensures usability on tablets and phones.
- **Consistency**: Unified design tokens for colors, spacing, and typography.
- **Performance**: Optimized for large datasets using virtualization and efficient rendering.

## Usage

Components are designed to be composed together. For example, a Lead Detail page might combine `ProfileHeader`, `InteractionTimeline`, and `DocumentRepository`.

```tsx
import { ProfileHeader } from '@/components/crm/ProfileHeader';
import { InteractionTimeline } from '@/components/crm/InteractionTimeline';

function LeadPage({ lead, activities }) {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <ProfileHeader lead={lead} />
      <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        <div className="col-span-2">
          {/* Main content */}
        </div>
        <div className="col-span-1">
          <InteractionTimeline activities={activities} />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
